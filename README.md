# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

**Note** Added snowpack-web-ext plugin and updated snowpack config because Chrome complaint about the __snowpack__ folder.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode and opens a Chrome browser with the extension loaded.

Extension reloads by triggering a new action once re-build completed.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles Preact in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
